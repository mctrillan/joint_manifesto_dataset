# joint_manifesto_dataset
This project contains R code to merge the Comparative Party Pledge Group and Manifesto Project datasets. Step-by-step instructions can be found in the script. It will run from start to finish as long as the user has placed the relevant files in the correct directories and edits the code accordingly.

This script uses the MP API to download the latest dataset. Users need to have a Manifesto Project account to access the data (https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu). assumes the user has access to a local copy of the CPPG data. The code is designed to allow users flexibility in the variables to take from the MP data.
