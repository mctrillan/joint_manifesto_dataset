# joint_manifesto_dataset
This project contains R code to merge the Comparative Party Pledge Project (CPPP) and Manifesto Project (MARPOR) datasets with manifestos as observations. The code is designed to allow users flexibility in the variables to take from the MARPOR data.

Step-by-step instructions have been commented into the script. It will run from start to finish as long as the user has placed the relevant files in the correct directories and edits the code accordingly. Users must also download ajps_names.csv and marpor_names.csv and place them in the working directory.

This script uses the MARPOR API to download the latest dataset. Users need to have a Manifesto Project account to access the data (https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu) and have access to a local .dat format copy of the CPPP data (available here https://bit.ly/2WK3KHb, save in working directory with file name "pledges.ajps.dta").
